# Smart India Hackathon 22 Project (ID: VM 742)

## Description
The Smart India Hackathon Project involves the development of an IoT-based system designed to monitor and control environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. The project integrates various hardware and software components to provide real-time data and automated control.

## Key Skills Used
- Embedded C
- Circuit Design
- API Integration
- Java

## Features
- **IoT Integration:** Connected hardware (Arduino and sensors) with software to enable seamless communication for real-time monitoring and control of temperature and humidity levels.
- **ESP8266 WiFi Module:** Programmed to transmit real-time sensor data to a custom-built mobile app using appropriate communication protocols.
- **Weather Forecasting API:** Integrated to automatically adjust environmental controls in response to sudden weather changes.
- **Bilingual Mobile App:** Designed and developed an app in both Hindi and English to help farmers easily monitor and control environmental conditions.
