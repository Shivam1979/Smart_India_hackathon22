## Project Description
The project involved creating an integrated IoT system with the following features:

- **Hardware Integration**: Utilized Arduino and DHT11 sensors to measure temperature and humidity levels in real-time. The system controls the environment by turning the heater and compressor on and off based on sensor readings.

- **WiFi Communication**: Programmed the ESP8266 WiFi module to transmit real-time sensor data to a custom-built mobile app, allowing remote monitoring and control.

- **Weather Forecasting**: Integrated a weather forecasting API to adjust environmental controls in response to sudden changes in weather conditions, ensuring optimal conditions are maintained.

- **Mobile App Development**: Designed and developed a bilingual (Hindi and English) mobile app to enable farmers to easily monitor and manage temperature and humidity levels from their mobile devices.

## Installation
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect the DHT11 sensors to the Arduino board.
   - Integrate the ESP8266 WiFi module with the Arduino for data transmission.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Upload the Arduino code to the board using the Arduino IDE.
   - Set up the mobile app on your device.

3. **Configuration**:
   - Configure the weather forecasting API in the mobile app for accurate data.

## How to Use
1. **Monitoring**: Open the mobile app to view real-time temperature and humidity data.
2. **Control**: Use the app to switch between manual and automatic modes for controlling environmental conditions.
3. **Weather Forecast**: The app will automatically adjust controls based on weather forecasts.
